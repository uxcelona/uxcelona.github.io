    <p>Let‚Äôs start from the beginning, what is UX?</p>

<p>The term UX design is short for User Experience.  User Experience consists of optimizing the users experience on a website.</p>

<p>UX design is therefore one of the keys to the effectiveness of your website, especially knowing how much competition there is.
Your website needs to stand out. There are hundreds of sites competing with you. Your goal is to make your website a pleasent experience for the user.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1>User Experince Design Tips</h1>

<p>Like I said, you must ensure that your visitor‚Äôs experience is as pleasant as possible so that they can easily find the information or product they need and make their purchase or appointment on your site as flawless as possible.</p>

<h2>How to improve the user experience on your website?</h2>

<p>The UX design is a subject that affects the webdesign of your site in its entirety: ergonomics, choice of the architecture of your pages, your menu, your colors, your call to action buttons buttons. The slightest word has every importance!
Here we reveal UX design tips to optimize the user experience and convert your visitors into customers. This will also help
to improve your overall SEO. If you don‚Äôt know about SEO, you should check out <a href="/why-seo-important">why SEO is so important.</a></p>

<h2>Loading speed</h2>

<p>Optimize the loading speed of your website</p>

<p>As a <a href="/">Freelance Web Designer for Barcelona</a> I try to offer the best solution to my customers. It does not really help when my page need 8 seconds to load. Also 5 seconds does not help. My goal for my page it to load between 1-2 seconds.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not really a design aspect, but still very important, the speed at which your site loads impacts the user experience: indeed, what could be more frustrating than being stuck on a page that doesn‚Äôt load. I am sure you knwo these kind of pages.</p>

<p>If your page takes more than 3 seconds to load, your visitor may leave your site, increasing your bounce rate. Then never come back.</p>

<p>So what is the solution?</p>

<p>If you want your visitors to stay on your website, make sure that your site loads quickly, for example by compressing your images, JPEG or PNG images and not overloading your video pages.</p>

<h2>Optimize action buttons with UX design</h2>

<p>CTAs, in English call to action, are the buttons on which your visitors must click to convert them. It can therefore be a purchase button if it is an e-business site but not only.
The goal can also be to download a white paper, fill in a contact form, subscribe to a newsletter‚Ä¶ everything depends on your activity and the purpose you are looking for.</p>

<p>To improve the design of your CTAs and therefore increase your conversion rate, here are some useful tips:</p>

<h2>Place the ATC above the fold</h2>
<p>For your action button to be effective and facilitate the conversion of your visitors, it must be immediately visible, i.e. located above the waterline of your site: in other words, the visitors must not have to scroll your page to make the button appear. Also consider testing the rendering on smartphones and optimize your layout accordingly!</p>

<h2>Play with colour contrasts to bring out the CTA</h2>
<p>Simple ideas are often the best. Use a color that contrasts with the background of your site so that the button stands out and catches the eye!</p>

<h2>Play on the design of your CTA</h2>

<figure>
<img src="/cta-design-ux-barcelona.png" alt="cta design black background orange color" />
<figcaption>It should be compelling to click the button.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The two designers have several strings to their bow to improve the effectiveness of their call to action.  You can also play on the size of the button, its shape (more or less rounded), highlight it or not with arrows or elements around it. It‚Äôs up to you!</p>

<h2>Test CTA's wording</h2>
<p>Try different approaches, focusing on the benefit for your visitor. For example, ‚ÄúReceiving my guide‚Äù will probably work better than ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù. But no absolute truth, only one thing to do: test it!</p>

<h2>Adapt the CTA to the qualification level of your leads</h2>
<p>Last but not least: adapt the message and the action requested according to the level of qualification on your leads.
On which page of your site are they located, to which message(s) (emailing, facebook ads?) have they been exposed before? The action you ask them to take on CTA must be consistent with what they have read before they arrive on your page.</p>

<h2>Optimize the UX design of the navigation menu</h2>
<p>An effective menu should not be too busy: so limit entries to a maximum of 6 or 7 and avoid extended drop-down menus. The user experience will be improved if the menu is aerated and constantly shows the visitor where he or she is, for example by displaying the currently visited section in a different color.</p>

<p>It is also customary to place links to your contact page and customer support in the upper right corner: respect these codes. Do not hesitate either to indicate your telephone number at the top right of your page: clearly visible, it is a vector of reinsurance for your prospects and therefore a conversion facilitator.</p>

<p>Work on the internal mesh so that each page is accessible in three clicks.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt you like having to click half a dozen times to finally get to the product or information you‚Äôre looking for?</p>
