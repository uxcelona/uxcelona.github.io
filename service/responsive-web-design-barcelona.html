                <p>With my Responsive Webdesign service, I create mobile websites for
                    every device out there. No matter if you are using an <strong>iPhone 5</strong>, an iPhone X, a 
                    Samsung Galaxy S8, an iPad or even an <strong>Tablet</strong> or a Phablet. 
                    <br><br>
                    Your content should flow like water. What I mean by that is, no matter how wide 
                    the <strong>screen size</strong>, your titles, your images and the whole content 
                    should adapt itself to it. It should “render well”.</p>

        
                <p>
                To make this work, I use CSS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries">Media Queries (@media)</a>. T
                his is essential for adjusting the content for every viewport and for every browser. No worries, as a <a href="/">Freelance Web Designer from Barcelona</a>,
                I'll take care of your style sheets and your markup!

                <p>
                Mobile First is a very common technique used in the <strong>web development world.</strong> Every web designer mostly starts with implementing 
                the styles and the content for the smallest <strong>viewport</strong> available. 
                From there on, it is much easier to make the content fit into a <strong>bigger screen</strong> like a desktop Screen Size.
                <br><br>
                I use the <strong>preprocessor</strong> Sass for styling the markup on your page. Mobile First and Responsive 
                web design is getting even more important, because Google is rolling out the “mobile first index”. 
                In other words, when your content isn’t made for <strong>smartphones</strong> and when your page 
                can not be viewed with ease on an iPhone, Google will stop <strong>indexing</strong> your page in 
                the search results. Which is a very big impact in terms of <a href="/seo-barcelona">Search Engine Optimization.</a> 
                You will miss tons of quality traffic.
