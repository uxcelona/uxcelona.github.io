                <h2>From Backlinks to On-Page and technical SEO</h2>
        
                <p>The goal of every <strong>search engine optimization project</strong> is to increase the visibility in the organic search results, 
                    also called <strong>SERPS</strong>. In other words, you don’t have to pay for advertising anymore. 
                    You will get your traffic from Googles organic results. This is pretty awesome. 
                    <br><br>
                    You just need to <strong>optimize</strong> your page and if you choose the right <strong>keywords</strong> 
                    which contains <strong>primary and secondary keywords</strong>, you can get a pretty decent ranking in the 
                    Search Engine Results Page within a few months.
                <br><br>
                There are tons of important factors which you have to consider when optimising your page, Google <strong>Algorithm</strong> gets smarter every day and the most important thing is, to fullfill the right <stong>user intent</stong> with your website.
                </p>
        
                <h2>User Intent and Rank Brain</h2>
        
                <p>
                What I mean by that is, if you visitors just need a quick information how to get from point A to your shop, don’t start talking about your history. Many SEO’s always say <strong>content is king</strong>, however this is only true if you are also able to satisfy the intent of the user. If the user needs a <strong>comprehend</strong> piece of content, like an information about how to change a certain lifestyle, offer him a long and <strong>valuable blog post</strong> which he loves to refer to.
                </p>
        
        
        
                <h2>SEO Audits for Barcelona</h2>
        
                <p>
                What I do to increase your page ranking is, first of all I <strong>analyse your page.</strong> 
                I check the <strong>User Experience</strong> on the Page and the overall feeling I get from it. 
                Then I check several SEO factors including the following:
                </p>
        
                <br>
        
                <ul class="ul-list">
                <li>Content Analysis</li>
                <li>Technical SEO (H1 Tags, robots.txt files and Sitemap files)</li>

                <br><br>
