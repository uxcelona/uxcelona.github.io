                <h2>User Intent and Rank Brain</h2>
        
                <p>
                What I mean by that is, if you visitors just need a quick information how to get from point A to your shop, don’t start talking about your history. Many SEO’s always say <strong>content is king</strong>, however this is only true if you are also able to satisfy the intent of the user. If the user needs a <strong>comprehend</strong> piece of content, like an information about how to change a certain lifestyle, offer him a long and <strong>valuable blog post</strong> which he loves to refer to.
                </p>
