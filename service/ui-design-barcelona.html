                <p>As a Freelance Web Designer, I strive to provide Barcelona with modern, simple & clean <strong>Websites.</strong> My Freelance service includes the complete production of a Website, starting with the User Interface (UI) Design. I believe every website should focus on <strong>User Experience</strong> before anything else.
                    <br><br>
                    We need to improve the <strong>usability</strong> because otherwise, no matter how good-looking your page is, you won’t get any <strong>conversions.</strong> An user shouldn’t have a hard time to reach his goal. Whether it is to get informed, to buy your product or get to know your service. All the <strong>visual elements</strong> need to work with each other, and it is important, to use the right Typo. <strong>Typography</strong> can make or break the whole page.</p>
                    <br>
                    
        
                    <p>Since I am responsible for the full production of your website, I offer web development, wordpress webdesign, search engine optimization, responsive webdesign & web hosting solutions as well.
                    <h2>Page Layout</h2>
                    <p>
                    I make sure the <strong>page layout</strong> is adapted to your overall <strong>business vision</strong> and to your business goals. Your identity needs to be in line with your audience so you can communicate your “Why’s” in a proper way.</p>

                    <p>
                    For everything I design, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(graphic_design)">grid technologies</a> to make sure, that your page looks good on every kind of device, doesn’t matter if it is the new <strong>iPhone X</strong>, an Android phone or some kind of a tablet or wait… the things in between which are called <strong>“phablets”</strong> nowadays.
                    <br><br>
                    I design every page with <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> which is a beautiful software or let’s call it a “digital design toolkit”. Sketch enables me to do iOS Mirroring, to use <strong>Grids and Guides,</strong> to export my Code & to edit Vectors. I can combine symbols and sync my <strong>design</strong> to all devices, which is pretty awesome.
                    <br><br>
                    After the Design is done, I write the Markup with HTML and CSS and to breath life into your page I use Javascript, but this is more a development thing. Check the <a href="web-development-barcelona">web development</a> section for more information on this.
