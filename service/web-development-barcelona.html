		<h2>Front End Development</h2>

		<p>There is nothing that I outsource and I don’t work with <strong>WYSIWYG Software.</strong> Specialised as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>, I am able to code pages with CMS like WordPress or with a static site generators like Jekyll along with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
		<br><br>
		I make sure your page will work with every common <strong>Browser</strong> like Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox. Of course I make sure that Internet Explore can handle the <strong>code</strong> as well.
		<br><br>	
		The Text Editor I use is Sublime Text and I follow all the important rules from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. clean code and is essential for a good working page. There are tons of <strong>libraries</strong>, which makes coding pages much easier, sometimes you just don’t need to re-invent the wheel, however in most cases, I don’t use these libraries like <strong>Bootstrap.</strong>
		<br><br>
		I like my code to be fully personalised for your needs. For my <strong>CSS Markup</strong> I am using the css preprocessor <strong>SASS.</strong>
		<br><br>
		If you need a E-Commerce website, I code the Front-End in conjunction with <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> & <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. <strong>WordPress</strong> is great for dynamic Pages.
		<br><br>
		If you use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static page</a>, which is a website that doesn’t work with a database, I will help you to create a <strong>GitHub Account</strong> and I will create your Page with the static site generator <strong>Jekyll</strong>. With this interaction you are able to host your page on GitHub, which is one of the most reliable and safest places to host a website.
