            <p>
                Inspired by Barcelonas beautiful nature like the Llobregat and the Besòs river, 
                my goal is to provide Antoni Gaudis Hometown with individualised solutions for web design, 
                web development, wordpress customisation & search engine optimization (on-page as well as off-page seo). 
                <br><br>
                Whether it be for an individual like an entrepreneur, a personal trainer, or a 
                famous blogger. I can help you to fulfil your project with a personalized 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a> design, 
                a solution for your web hosting problems (without monthly costs) 
                and I can make your website more alive with my favourite coding language - 
                Javascript (ES6). 
                <br><br>
                Furthermore I can take a look at your homepage and 
                provide it with an engaging User Experience. My goal is to leave the 
                web a better place. Since I am already talking about User Experience, 
                one thing that goes hand in hand with UX is SEO Marketing. 
                SEO solves a VERY common problem most webmasters suffer from: traffic.
